# RevyOS Newsletter (2025-01 #0015)

## Editor's Note

The New Year’s bell has rung—Happy New Year to everyone! Looking back at the past year, we’ve witnessed the growth and progress of RevyOS, a journey made possible thanks to the support and efforts of every user, developer, and community partner.  

At the end of last year, we introduced two brand-new images for Milk-V Meles and LicheePi 4A devices. After a long adaptation period, these images, updated with the latest SDK and kernel, are finally available. They not only showcase RevyOS's commitment to staying updated but also offer users more diverse options and improved experiences.  

We’re also excited to share two great pieces of news: the software ecosystems for LicheePi 4A and Milk-V Meles have officially joined the RuyiSDK project! Additionally, the PLCT Laboratory hosted its annual Open Day in December 2024, where multiple PLCT partners actively participated and shared their progress and achievements.  

As we step into the New Year, we hope you’ll continue to look forward to RevyOS’s growth. We are committed to delivering an even better experience in the year ahead! With such a fulfilling end to the year, let’s dive into the details below.
