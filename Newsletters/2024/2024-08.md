# RevyOS Newsletter (2024-08 #0010)

## Editor's Note

Welcome to the 10th issue of the RevyOS Newsletter. This monthly update synchronizes the latest developments in RevyOS, and we hope everyone will continue to pay attention to and use RevyOS! This month, we have many image updates, and we have added support for the Lichee Book 4A image. Additionally, we have introduced a dedicated image for the LicheeConsole4A. Previously, LicheeConsole4A could use the 4A image, but now you can download from the new image directory. Currently, RevyOS supports most devices in the Lichee series, and each device has its own independent image directory. This month has seen a plethora of RISC-V related activities, from the Tokyo Day at the beginning of the month to the 2024 RISC-V China Summit towards the end of the month. Alongside the China Summit, there are many concurrent activities waiting for participation. To stay updated with the latest news, don't miss out on the related reports. Now, let's take a look at the specific updates below.
