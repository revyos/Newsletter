# RevyOS Newsletter (2024-06 #008)

## Editor's Note

Happy Children's Day! Welcome to the eighth issue of the RevyOS Newsletter. This monthly publication provides the latest updates on RevyOS. We hope you continue to follow and use RevyOS! After completing tasks such as SDK upgrades and SD card boot functionality, we finally have an image update this month! The bad news is that the updated images will not be synced to the mirror site this month. The good news is that a functional update image will be available on the mirror site next month. If you're interested in the new changes and want to experience them early, you can download them via the links below. This month's code changes are mostly focused on U-boot and kernel-related updates, along with updates to the GStreamer documentation and numerous package fixes for ROS. Let's take a look at the specific details for this month!

## Image Update

The images are released on GitHub with separate links for U-boot and image downloads. The image download link includes the new LicheePi 4A image, the mainline kernel version image for both LicheePi 4A and LicheePi Cluster 4A, the beaglev-ahead image, and the LicheeConsole4A image. The image download link contains versions for both emmc boot and SD card boot. Please download according to your needs.
