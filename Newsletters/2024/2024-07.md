# RevyOS Newsletter (2024-07 #009)

## Editor's Note

Welcome to the ninth issue of the RevyOS Newsletter. This monthly newsletter updates you on the latest progress of RevyOS. We are excited to announce that RevyOS now supports notebook devices and Milk-V Meles! It was showcased at the RISC-V European Summit, and some of you might have already experienced it there. Early this month, we made some minor tweaks to the image released at the end of last month and released a new version on the mirror site. Those who wish to use the new version can download it. RevyOS was also showcased at ewCN, where the latest image was demonstrated at the PLCT Lab booth. Now, let's dive into the detailed changes this month.
