# RevyOS Newsletter (2024-11 #0013)

## Editor's Note

Welcome to the 13th edition of the RevyOS Newsletter! This month, we continue to bring you the latest updates on RevyOS. We have released two official images and one test image. Over the past month, the team has made significant improvements and added key features to the sg2042 kernel in preparation for the new SG2042 image release. Additionally, contributors to other project repositories have continued to provide updates and optimizations for glibc, Chromium, and Electron. In November, we plan to release usage videos of RevyOS on LicheePi4A and Milk-V Pioneer, so stay tuned. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to pushing RevyOS forward together!
